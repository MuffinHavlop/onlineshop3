            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <h3><p>Ai Hoshino was subjected to domestic violence by her mother who is the only parent she knew in her childhood.<br>
                Later on, Ai's mom was arrested for theft when Ai was at a very tender age. When she was thrown behind bars, Ai had to go live in an orphanage for the period she served her jail time. However, when she was released, she didn't come back to the orphanage to pick her daughter up, which is the reason she had to stay in the orphanage and grow up within its walls.<br>
                When Ai became twelve, the president of Strawberry Productions, Ichigo Saitou, scouted her out and offered her a job as an idol. At the time, she thought she wasn't fit for the job since she never knew how to love and how to be loved. Nevertheless, Ichigo managed to convince her by explaining to her that she didn't need to know and that lying can work just as well. He gave her hope - that she would be able to turn that lie into truth. What followed was four successful years as the face of the popular idol group, B-Komachi.<br>
                At the age of 16, Ai met and began a secret relationship with 15-year-old Hikaru Kamiki, which resulted in her getting pregnant with twins. After hearing her manager/company president say that the world would not be for an idol with babies at the age of 16, she decided to keep her kids a secret from the outside world instead of completely getting rid of them, since she wanted to experience what a family is like. She managed to accomplish that feat to a certain extent as besides doing a fantastic job as the lead idol for B-Komachi, she even succeeded as an actor for a short while.</p></h3>
