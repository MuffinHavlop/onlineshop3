            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <h3><p>Mitsuri is a curvaceous young woman of average height and muscular build with a slightly pale complexion and round, pale green eyes with long eyelashes, a small beauty mark beneath each of them. She has long, light pink hair that fades into a lime green color at the halfway point, which she wears in three thick braids. She has five shorter, choppy clumps hanging over her face as voluminous bangs, the tips lime green as well. When she was trying to get married, her hair was dyed black in an attempt to make herself look more "normal." Mitsuri's Demon Slayer Mark appears as two hearts with winged shapes under the both of the hearts, Mitsuri's Mark seems to be on the left side of her neck.<br>
                Mitsuri wears a heavily modified pink tinted version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform along with a plain white haori that was gifted to her by Kyojuro Rengoku.[5] The chest area of her uniform is left unbuttoned and she wears a short pleated skirt in place of the usual tattsuke-hakama pants. Additionally, she wears a pair of navy blue thigh-high socks layered with the vertically striped lime-green socks Obanai Iguro gave to her and a pair of white z≈çri with pink straps.<br>
                Mitsuri is a very emotional, passionate, and jovial individual who constantly compliments people in her head, likely a contributing factor towards her nickname as "the Hashira of Love." Although she is rather shy and is easily flustered, Mitsuri is always kind to others, most notably towards Obanai, whom she appears to share a strong bond with. However, despite her gentle and seemingly innocent demeanor, Mitsuri will show no mercy in the face of demons, instead expressing such sentiments with a fierce tone. She showcases a great amount of dedication to the Demon Slayers' cause. Despite being put out of commission by Muzan at an early stage in their battle, she was determined enough to return and fight.<br>
